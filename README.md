# N-Queens Problem Solver

This repository contains a solution for the classic N-Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Overview

The N-Queens problem is a famous combinatorial problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. The challenge is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Solves the N-Queens problem for any given N.
- Provides both a recursive backtracking algorithm and an iterative approach.
- Visualizes the solution on a text-based board.
- Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the solution.
